Hi, I'm Andy Koop and I created li3t because I see an ever-growing gap between organizations doing work and the vendors that sell them products. 

## The Lifecycle

I've worked in the field of Educational Technology for 22 years and I have seen a lot of EdTech companies go from small/medium to huge. There is a predictable pattern as these companies grow obligated to growth. There is a sincerity and urgency to the initial products in the incubator stage. Customers are excited. Sales is excited. Hell, even the engineers are excited. But, years later we see engineers leave. New engineers come in with less understanding of the product. These engineers slowly peel off due to attrition and are replaced by well meaning sales reps and product managers. But, the customer is left in a lurch within a rapidly evolving sector and standing multiple new tools in-hand that don't integrate with an already stale product in many cases. 

With under resourced tech offices on one island and overworked EdTech engineers on another, the chance of true success is slim. The customer keeps changing out vendors or purchasing new products to fix nagging problems unaddressed by the EdTech company. Neither side can seem to bridge the gap, so we see a cycle of growth, stagnation, and exodus. 

## The Fix

At li3t, we aim to listen to what ails your systems and bridge the gap for you. It often turns out your old tools can talk to your new tools. They just need an intermediary layer. Yes, we'll stay up into the night and talk to the vendors and find the engineers tucked away pulling double shifts. Suddenly, your productivity apps will talk to your employee database and vice-versa.
