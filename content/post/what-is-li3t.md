## That sounds magical

To witness a series of disconnected systems changeover to a customized machine can certainly leave you feeling buzzy. It's not magic, but the results feel magical. 

## Sounds...expensive

That all depends. A small company or non-profit might only need a few hours of transformative work. A mature organization with many disconnected systems might need a fuller engagement. Cost is relative and on a sliding scale. 

## Who is doing all the connecting here?
